# Tailwind CSS Instructions

## Tailwind CSS v4 Configuration

This project uses Tailwind CSS v4.1.14 via the `@tailwindcss/vite` plugin.

### Global CSS Setup

- Import Tailwind in `global.css`: `@import "tailwindcss";`
- No separate `tailwind.config.js` file is used
- Configuration is handled through the Vite plugin

## Dark Theme Styling

ALL UI components MUST use dark theme colors:

### Color Palette

- Background colors: `bg-slate-800`, `bg-slate-900`, `bg-slate-950`
- Text colors: `text-slate-100`, `text-slate-200`, `text-slate-300`
- Border colors: `border-slate-700`, `border-slate-600`
- Accent colors for hover/focus states

### Common Patterns

- Cards and containers: `bg-slate-800 rounded-xl p-6 shadow-lg`
- Hover effects: `hover:bg-slate-700 transition-colors duration-200`
- Borders: `border border-slate-700`
- Gradients for visual interest: `bg-gradient-to-br from-slate-800 to-slate-900`
- Backdrop effects: `backdrop-blur-sm bg-slate-900/50`

### Responsive Design

- Use responsive prefixes: `sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`, `xl:`
- Mobile-first approach
- Ensure readability on all screen sizes

## Utility Classes

- Prefer utility classes over custom CSS when possible
- Use semantic grouping: layout, spacing, colors, typography
- Keep utility combinations readable and maintainable

## Modern UI Patterns

- Rounded corners: `rounded-lg`, `rounded-xl`, `rounded-2xl`
- Smooth transitions: `transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out`
- Shadows for depth: `shadow-md`, `shadow-lg`, `shadow-xl`
- Focus states for accessibility: `focus:ring-2 focus:ring-blue-500`

## Comments and documentation philosophy

- Prefer comments that explain intent, trade-offs, and constraints. If the code is obvious, do not add a comment.
- Do not write comments that simply repeat the code in prose, especially for utility classes or markup that already reads clearly.
- Update or remove stale comments whenever the surrounding code changes; outdated comments make the codebase less trustworthy.

## TypeScript and formatting expectations

- Use explicit TypeScript types for exported functions, component props, and helper return values.
- Keep function names and variable names descriptive; prefer intent-revealing names over abbreviations.
- Follow the repository's ESLint configuration for readable formatting and consistent code quality; do not add new rules that conflict with the project's established setup.
- Prefer small, single-purpose functions and components to reduce the need for explanatory comments.
